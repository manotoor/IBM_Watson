Bugs on my end:
[ ] classify images not importing / loading properly (however, the package is visible in my dependencies)

Suggestions:
[ ] have 2 different buttons for choose and to classify the image
             - choose places image in tray
             - "classify" or "get ingredients" classifies the image
